# GitHub Pages Portfolio

## 1. Project Title and Description
This project creates a personal GitHub Pages site serving a collection of diverse files as specified by a project brief. It demonstrates proficiency in generating various content types including a short story, ethical dilemma analyses, personal descriptions, SVG graphics, restaurant recommendations, economic predictions, and a comprehensive HTML index page, all compliant with specified formats and content requirements.

## 2. Setup Instructions
This project is designed to be hosted directly on GitHub Pages. No local setup or build process is required beyond cloning the repository.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Navigate to "Settings" -> "Pages".
    *   Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch".
    *   Choose your primary branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and `/ (root)` for the folder.
    *   Click "Save".
    *   Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/` within a few minutes. The `index.html` file will serve as the homepage.

## 3. Usage Guide
Once the GitHub Pages site is live, simply navigate to the provided URL. The `index.html` page serves as the main navigation hub, providing links to all other files in the project. Click on any link to view its content directly in your browser.

*   `ashravan.txt`: Read a Brandon Sanderson-inspired short story.
*   `dilemma.json`: Examine the ethical considerations for an autonomous vehicle.
*   `about.md`: Discover a three-word self-description.
*   `pelican.svg`: View an SVG graphic of a pelican riding a bicycle.
*   `restaurant.json`: Get a restaurant recommendation for Mumbai.
*   `prediction.json`: See an economic prediction and its rationale.
*   `LICENSE`: Review the project's MIT License.
*   `uid.txt`: Access a unique identifier file.

## 4. Code Explanation
The project is a collection of static files, each serving a specific purpose as outlined in the brief:

*   **`ashravan.txt`**: Contains a 300-400 word creative short story.
*   **`dilemma.json`**: A JSON file structured to answer two ethical questions regarding autonomous vehicle choices, including boolean decisions and string justifications.
*   **`about.md`**: A simple Markdown file containing three descriptive words.
*   **`pelican.svg`**: An SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file that programmatically draws a pelican on a bicycle using paths, circles, and lines.
*   **`restaurant.json`**: A JSON file providing details for a restaurant recommendation, including geographic coordinates and food suggestions.
*   **`prediction.json`**: A JSON file forecasting a future economic metric (Fed Funds rate) with a numerical value and a textual explanation.
*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point to the site, providing a styled HTML page with clear descriptions and direct links to all other assets. This acts as a simple navigation menu.
*   **`LICENSE`**: Contains the standard text for the MIT License.
*   **`uid.txt`**: A plain text file containing a unique identifier string, included as-is.

The file structure is flat, meaning all files reside in the root directory, making them easily accessible via relative paths from `index.html`.
